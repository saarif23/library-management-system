      "short_description": "The Lands of Lost Borders: A Journey on the Silk Road is a travelogue which remains true to its titular name. It is, in its essence, the year-long story of the author's journey along the Silk Road, with her childhood best friend, Melissa Yule, on a bike. During her adolescent years, Kate Harris had the nomadic urge to become a generalist explorer and a philosopher. She wanted to become a scientist as well and travel to Mars. In all honesty, her trip along the Silk Road to idle away the broad hours before her take-off for Mars was only a means to a narrow end. A decision she would soon make once after, because one time is hardly ever enough. Interweaving facts, science, and the (Silky) pathway to the stars, Kate Harris' debut biography is a unique take on the travelogue sub-genre. It deviates from the regular humdrum of the sea and the mountains and literally takes you down on the streets. "

Many cannot, and actually could not, when Monisha Rajesh first announced her plans to circumnavigate the world in exactly 80 trains. But board the first train she did, packing up her rucksack and fiancé, to embark on an extraordinary adventure of diverse train stations and eccentric, unifying cultures. An adventure that took her from Tibet's Qinghai station to the Venice Simplon-Orient Express, from the great London's St Pancras station to the vast expanse of countries around the world. An ode to train travels, this book would be an ideal read for lovers of both trains and the world. "
